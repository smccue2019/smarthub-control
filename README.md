# smarthub-control
Creates an interactive widget to set routing of a Blackmagic Smarthub.
The app interrogates the Smarthub for input and output labels. Out
labels are fixed, in labels are formed into a dropdown list from which the
user selects. Developed to allow science watchstanders in Jason's van to
remotely control the Smarthub directing video signals to Jason recorders.
